A former coder, Linux geek since 1997 and science fiction novelist. While I am experienced with C++ and a bit of Python, most of the code I write nowadays starts with `#!/bin/sh`.

I am from **[Bochum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bochum)** in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, a city of culture and knowledge. My first novel has been published in April 2014 under a part-pseudonym.

A second novel, taking place in a truly enormous and whimsical universe ruled by a crazed artificial intelligence, had been in preparation since 2016 and was scheduled for November 2020, however ongoing real-life defamation — for unknown reasons —, stalking and WHOIS doxxing since around mid-2019 have prevented me from completing my life project. All my domains connectable to my real name and my then-writer pseudonym had to be taken offline. However, I managed to develop another novel material during the initial crisis stages. That one conveys a simpler and more straightforward story revolving about people who lost their memory to an illness, and seek revenge thereupon.

Three and a half years later I feel able to program on a consistent level again and have started coding an open-world sci-fi RPG game engine in Java which currently resides in a private GitHub repository. A narrative driven game based on the engine could potentially be used to convey the story originally intended to be told by the second novel.

To help other writers of fiction I have created a calculation spreadsheet that is compatible with several office suites.

I also run a **[Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing)** relay server on a Raspberry Pi 5 so I wrote a `top` for it.

As an anime fan I could not help myself but to create a script toolchain for re-muxing the good stuff. Everything in Unix sh.
