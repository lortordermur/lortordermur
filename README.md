A former coder, Linux geek since 1997 and science fiction novelist. While I am experienced with C++ and a bit of Python, most of the code I write nowadays starts with `#!/bin/sh`.

I am from [Bochum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bochum) in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, a city of culture and knowledge. My first novel, *ASKENDUM*, has been published in April 2014 under the part-pseudonym *Deon R. Murczak*.

My second novel, a truly enormous and whimsical universe ruled by a crazed artificial intelligence, has been in preparation since 2016. Currently I am working on the third plot draft with no end in sight.

To help other writers of fiction I have created a calculation spreadsheet that is compatible with several office suites.

I am also running a [Syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing) relay server on a Raspberry Pi 2 so I wrote some kind of `top` for it.

As an anime fan I could not help myself but to create a script toolchain for re-muxing the good stuff. Everything in Unix sh.
